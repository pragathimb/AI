**Contribution** : Pragathi - Manually solved few examples of standard Minimax algorithm ,wrote  pseudocode of standard
Minimax and then coded the logic for minimax algorithm . Merged two algorithm codes .Tried all test cases provided along with different examples and executed the code successfully.
**Contribution** : Pavani - Manually solved few examples of Alpha-Beta Pruning ,wrote  pseudocode of standard
Minimax and then coded the logic forAlpha-Beta Pruning . Merged two algorithm codes .Tried all test cases provided along with different examples and executed the code successfully.

**How to run the code** - 1)copy and paste the source code to main.py 
                          2)upload input.txt file .The inout.txt file contains the any one testcase out of 3 
                          3)Run the code
                          4)output / output.txt file appears with the ouput matching to the testcase we have passed in input.txt
